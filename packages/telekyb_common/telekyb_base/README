here is different 
that you need the yaml-cpp with the new api

I think its version 1.5 an higher

* go to the website (google yaml-cpp) or find the tar ball in the repo
* download and install the lib where ever you like

* tell cmake where to find your installation
** to do so
** find the FindYamlCpp.cmake (in the cmake_scripts folder)
** alter the findpath order so that your path is high enough 

but be carefull

if you have a second version of the yaml cpp
and the yaml-cpp found is the old version
you get some nasty linker errors wile building
